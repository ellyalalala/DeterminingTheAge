# DeterminingTheAge

Determining the age of buyers
The Khleb-Sol chain supermarket introduces a computer vision system for processing customer photos. Photo recording in the checkout area will help determine the age of customers in order to:
Analyze purchases and offer products that may be of interest to buyers of this age group;
Monitor the integrity of cashiers when selling alcohol.
Build a model that will determine the approximate age of a person from a photograph. At your disposal is a set of photographs of people indicating their age.

Instructions for completing the project:
-Conduct an exploratory analysis of a set of photographs.
-Prepare the data for training.
-Train a neural network and calculate its quality.
